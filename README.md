# React.js Project

This project uses React.js HTML, CSS, Javascript, node.js, npm and JSON Package.
It is my very first project to learn how to link every component in React, how to write react based on the Life Cylcle Hook of React
and how to use node with npm package.

Enough with the explanation, meet my family!!
